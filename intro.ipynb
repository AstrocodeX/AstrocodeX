    "The {term}`AstroCodEx` is a community-built and maintained set of modular exercises designed to target key programming skills needed in astronomical research.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The exercises within the codex span a wide range of astronomical topics, use a multitude of astrophysical datasets, and can be mixed and matched as desired by instructors to fit their pedagogical needs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Every assignment in the codex is peer-reviewed, and are also living documents --- educators (who are free to download and modify the exercises at will) can create pull requests to make additions, improvements, or alternate versions of the exercises. The exercises also have associated tests which confirm they can be successfully completed under different and updating versions of the packages used. Furthermore, the use of the `myst-tools` framework allows for rich assignment augmentation, including hover-text for cross referencing definitions, equations, or links, as well as the ability to create annotations such as notes, hints, and warnings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every exercise is tagged with one or more ```Core Programming Skills``` --- e.g., \"control flow: conditionals\", \"control flow: looping:, \"library: numpy\". The astronomical examples used to illustrate these skills range from simple (no data, astronomy 101 equations such as Kepler's Law) to extensive (the entire 3D-HST survey, or a snapshot from TNG50). The focus is on the programming research skill, so while brief summaries of the astrophysics involved in an exercise are provided, it is up to instructors to fill in any gaps or to select exercises which align with their course content. \n",
    "\n",
    "At current, the codex has a focus on exercises in the Python programming language, but exercises in other languages are also welcome. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation \n",
    "\n",
    "The driving motivation for the creation of the codex is that crafting high quality exercises that effectively teach research coding skills is *challenging* and *time consuming*. Traditionally, such exercises (or whole assignments) have been developed by instructors in isolation for various courses. The (in some ways unfortunate) direction our field is taking is one prioritizing research skills at the undergraduate level --- this is necessary, more than ever, for graduate school admissions, but coding skills are also the single most useful graduating undergraduates could take into industry. There is thus a growing conversation about the need to transition the means by which early-career undergraduateslearn research coding skills, from a mix of \n",
    "- external summer internships (e.g., REUs)\n",
    "- haphazard picking up of skills from inheriting code and asking around\n",
    "- bootcamps\n",
    "- self teaching\n",
    "\n",
    "to actual courses focused on this skill (or the integration of such skills into the majority of undergraduate astronomy/astrophysics coursework). \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a noble goal, but an immediate challenge is the need for high quality exercises and mini-projects that can both teach core programming skills but also leverage the unique context such skills are used for in astronomy. Over the last decade, there has been a (welcome) increase in the amount of resources (usually guides/instructions/walk-throughs or textbooks) available to help one learn \"astronomical coding,\" but there has not existed a single, centralized repository of assignable exercises to help instructors put together coding-forward courses. \n",
    "\n",
    "Often instructors feel the need to do this themselves, in part because confirming that an abstract task (plot this relation from this dataset) actually *works* means doing it yourself. Our aim is to curate a set of peer reviewed (as in, someone who *should* be able to complete the exercise has attempted it and commented on it), *working*, exercises, which are small and modular enough in scope to be seamlessly integrated with whatever assignments or projects are being assigned by an instructor. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What is an Exercise?\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the term ```exercise``` throughout the codex to refer to the units of content in the repository. These are typically *not* the full length of a standard homework assignment, but several exercises together could constitute a full assignment. Some exercises are quite short (several lines of text, several lines of code), others are significantly more involved. Our goal is to have a modular set of these exercises that can be used as a scaffold to build out full assigments, or as a drop in to help target specific skillsets students may be struggling with. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the larger datasets used in the codex lend themselves to multiple exercises that may be somewhat related. You can browse the codex in multiple ways --- by dataset, which will group these together, or by ```CPS```, which groups exercises by the tagged skillsets they are targeting. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Programming Skills\n",
    "\n",
    "At current, we sort exercises by which so-called core programming skill they target or utilize. These are \n",
    "- UNIX/SHELL (filesystem navigation, environments, commands) \n",
    "- Basic Python (arithmetic, variables, datatypes)\n",
    "- Control Flow (conditionals, masks, loops)\n",
    "- Libraries (```numpy```, ```scipy```, ```astropy```, ```matplotlib```,```pandas```, etc.)\n",
    "- Data I/O (reading in ```ascii```, ```fits```, ```hdf5```, using different methods)\n",
    "- Functional Programming (defining functions, args, kwargs, packing/unpacking, scope, documentation)\n",
    "- Object Oriented Programming (defining classes, subclasses, methods, attributes, setters/getters, decorators, overloading)\n",
    "- Model Fitting (e.g., chi-squared, linear least squares, MCMC methods) \n",
    "- Numerical Methods (runge-kutta / n-body solver, fluids) \n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage \n",
    "\n",
    "The ```codex``` is organized as a ```juptyer-book``` built with ``myst`` tools. This allows for exercises to be rendered as webpages with rich text annotation (such as tips and warnings) which can also be rendered directly within ```jupyter``` notebooks. Any exercise can be downloaded as a notebook in one click from the page. Each exercise links appropriately to any needed external dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "Anyone is welcome to use, download, and modify the materials on this site. Materials can be re-published or posted with proper attribution, but we ask that *solutions* to the exercises in this repository (whether ours, or your own) *not* be distributed publicly. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Solutions** to the exercises are stored in a private GitHub repository within the ```astrocodex``` organization. Instructors desiring solutions for any subset of the exercises are encouraged to submit a request to imad.pasha@yale.edu. Solutions will be provided upon reasonable evidence of an instructor role. We ask instructors to use discretion with solutions; as these exercises are designed for use in a classroom setting, their longevity is aided by a lack of solution proliferation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Contributing\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```astrocodex``` is open source and we welcome contributions. If you have an exercise or set of exercises you think would fit well into the codex, you can create a submission following our submission guidelines. \n",
    "\n",
    "New exercises must meet several requirements to be considered, including:\n",
    "- notation of which CPSs are being targeted,\n",
    "- any data used must be frozen into a zenodo repository (we suggest first time contributers consider using a dataset already in the ```astrocodex``` zenodo!)\n",
    "- a solution set must be complete and confirmed to work, within a Python environment with an environment lock file provided (we ask that in general, new submissions use the most recent releases of any dependencies).\n",
    "- a short set of tests must be provided which, in essence, confirm the solutions work as intended (used for maintinence as packages upgrade over time).\n",
    "\n",
    "One can also submit PRs for existing assignments, accompanied by \n",
    "- Notation of whether the PR is an addition, alternate version, or correction/improvement to the assignment\n",
    "- Motivation for the proposed modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "PRs in both cases are reviewed by at least 2 members of the collaboration. All new assignments are actually completed during review, and suggestions might be made to improve the exercise (e.g., clarity). More details about how to set up submissions to the codex are available here. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyone who submits an accepted exercise, *or* makes an accepted pull request to improve, correct, or add to an existing assignment will be listed as a *contributer* to the codex. If you submit at least *five* exercises and make two accepted pull requests maintaining or updating existing assignments, you are eligible to become a member of the AstroCodEx collaboration. This entails \n",
    "- coauthorship on the full repository,\n",
    "- moderator access to review pending pull requests\n",
    "- membership in discussions about the overall direction and maintinance of the codex.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of whether you wish to join the collaboration, you will be asked if you would like coauthorship of the codex, when it is cited. \n",
